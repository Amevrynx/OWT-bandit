# Bandit Wargame – Linux & Security Walkthroughs

This repository documents my complete progression through the Bandit wargame by OverTheWire.

Bandit is a hands-on Linux security challenge designed to teach practical command-line skills, system enumeration, and an attacker-oriented problem-solving mindset. Each level introduces a new concept related to file systems, permissions, networking, and privilege escalation.

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Reinforce Linux fundamentals through practice
- Document solutions in a structured and reproducible way
- Track learning progress across all levels

## Platform Information

Wargame: OverTheWire – Bandit  
Website: https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/  
SSH Access:
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

Passwords discovered at each level are used to log into the next.

## Repository Structure

Each level is organized into its own directory.

Example:

```
bandit0/
  README.md

bandit1/
  READEME.md
```

Every walkthrough includes:
- Objective
- Enumeration steps
- Commands used
- Key concepts learned

This structure keeps the documentation modular, clear, and easy to revisit.
