# Bandit Wargame – Linux & Security Walkthroughs

This repository documents my complete progression through the Bandit wargame by OverTheWire.

Bandit is a hands-on Linux security challenge designed to teach practical command-line skills, system enumeration, and an attacker-oriented problem-solving mindset. Each level introduces a new concept related to file systems, permissions, networking, and privilege escalation.

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Reinforce Linux fundamentals through practice
- Document solutions in a structured and reproducible way
- Track learning progress across all levels
